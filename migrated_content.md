## Oct 2019 - Delaware Chapter meetup in flux

We are transitioning away from Meetup (99% sure...unless OWASP Global
can take over the account and get the $/RSVP fee waived as a
non-profit).

Meanwhile, this is the place to watch for news about the chapter, and
the meeting service we might use in the near future.

Please sign up to the mailing list at:
<https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/d/forum/delaware-chapter>

**Also follow & like us on social media:**

We are on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/owaspde

And on Facebook at https://facebook.com/groups/OWASP.Delaware

Admittedly, our social media has been a bit...malnourished.  Contact me
(<david.rhoades@owasp.org>) if you'd like to help.  

We can shower you with fame and glory\* in return for your help.

(\* Fame and glory not included.  But you can have a cool title and the
proper street cred that goes with it.)

## Chapter Survey

Do you want to attend local chapter meetings? Thinking about it? Then
let your voice be heard by filling out our survey here:

This will help us figure out what topics to cover, when to meet, where
to meet, etc.

## OWASP Delaware

Welcome to the official OWASP Delaware chapter homepage.
<b>[Click
here](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/d/forum/delaware-chapter) to
join the local chapter mailing list (a Google Group) or browse the
archives. </b>
NOTE: The mailing list migrated to Google Groups in 2019 and was not
promoted until Oct 2019. So it is a bit sparse at the moment.

It is a low volume mailing list, and the easiest way to stay informed.
<s> Our chapter has a Meetup.com page at
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Delaware-Chapter/>.
The short link is <http://bit.ly/owaspDE>.
</s>

If the meeting advertises <u>food</u> then be sure to **RSVP for
meetings** at the Meetup page so we can plan enough
[food](food ).
If you don't RSVP you might go hungry. You've been warned.


The chapter leader is [David Rhoades](mailto:David.Rhoades@owasp.org).
Contact him if you have questions or want to get involved.
