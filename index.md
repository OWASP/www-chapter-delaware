Welcome to the Delaware chapter homepage. 
Please follow our chapter on <a href="https://bit.ly/owaspDE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meetup.com</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/owaspde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.

Meetup is the primary source for meeting information and signups. **Please RSVP to meetings there**, but mark yourself as not coming if you change your mind.  That helps us plan for meeting logistics. 

> During hands-on labs there are only so many open seats, so an accurate head count is appreciated.

# Speakers & Sponsors Wanted

Please contact [David Rhoades](mailto:david.rhoades@owasp.org) if you would like to present at one of our chapter meetings, or if you have some space to donate for a meeting.
Northern Delaware is ideal, but we are flexible - especially if you have people in your area willing to attend.
